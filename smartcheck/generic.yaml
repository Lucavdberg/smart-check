- attributes:
  - reallocated_sector_count
  - reallocated_sector_ct
  raw_value: 0
  message: The drive has a non-zero Raw value, but there is no SMART warning yet. This could be an indication of future failures and/or potential data loss in bad sectors.

- attributes:
  - spin_up_retry_count
  raw_value: 0
  message: The drive has a non-zero Raw value, but there is no SMART warning yet. Your drive may have problems spinning up, which could lead to a complete mechanical failure.

- attributes:
  - soft_read_error_rate
  raw_value: 0
  message: The drive has a non-zero Raw value, but there is no SMART warning yet. This could be an indication of future failures and/or potential data loss in bad sectors.

- attributes:
  - temperature_celsius
  - temperature_celsius_x10
  raw_value: "50:120" # Temperature (for some it may be 10xTemp, so limit the upper bound.)
  message: The temperature of the drive is higher than 50 degrees Celsius. This may shorten its lifespan and cause damage under severe load.

- attributes:
  - temperature_celsius
  - temperature_celsius_x10
  raw_value: "500:" # Temperature (for some it may be 10xTemp, so limit the upper bound.)
  message: The temperature of the drive is higher than 50 degrees Celsius. This may shorten its lifespan and cause damage under severe load.

- attributes:
  - reallocation_event_count
  raw_value: 0
  message: The drive has a non-zero Raw value, but there is no SMART warning yet. This could be an indication of future failures and/or potential data loss in bad sectors.

  - total_pending_sectors
  raw_value: 0
  message: The drive has a non-zero Raw value, but there is no SMART warning yet. This could be an indication of future failures and/or potential data loss in bad sectors.

- attributes:
  - offline_uncorrectable
  - total_offline_uncorrectable
  raw_value: 0
  message: The drive has a non-zero Raw value, but there is no SMART warning yet. This could be an indication of future failures and/or potential data loss in bad sectors.

- attributes:
  - ssd_life_left
  value: ':50'
  message: The drive has less than half of its life left.
